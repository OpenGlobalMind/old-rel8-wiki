# Scribing Tools for Thinking

This page is base camp for people interested in "scribing" the [[Tools for Thinking Camp]] sessions that [Betaworks](betaworks.com) is hosting over the next few months. 

### Scribing?

There are many ways we might describe the activity of filtering, annotating, enhancing, connecting and mapping conversations, including:

- Scribing
- Annotating, Notetaking
- Context Weaving
- Curating
- Mapping

Let's pick one we love and rename the role (and this page). 

### This project

Betaworks is hosting a chain of events around the topic of Tools for Thinking, starting with [this Render session](https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking) on August 16. After that session, Jerry will host weekly Zoom sessions on this topic, leading up to the Think Camp, which is designed to accelerate 8 to 10 startups, which will go through an application process. 

In order to show how Tools for Thinking can actually enrich these conversations and interactions, Jerry is marshaling Scribes to participate as a bit of a [Greek Chorus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_chorus) during the events. (Scribes will get complimentary access to the Render session.)

Unlike Greek Choruses, which apparently were intentionally homogeneous, our Scribes will be quite individualistic: each will work in the tool of their choice, curating as they prefer to. Those apps will include Roam, Miro, Kumu, TheBrain, Obsidian and An Agora. 

Where possible, we will create linkages between the different sets of notes and maps, so that they form a loosely navigable whole. 

### Our Scribes

The following folks will be scribing the Tools for Thinking series:

- [[Jerry Michalski]], using TheBrain, [like this](https://bra.in/5qeDMg). His notes for these events will start [here](https://bra.in/4jrLy5). 
- [[Bill Seitz]], using his eponymous [SeitzWiki](http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/FrontPage) and [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 
- [[Jess Martin]]
- [[Darlene Dang]], using [Edvo](https://www.edvo.com/). Her notes will start [here](https://app.edvo.com/topic/Dw11GUNDXryRqjr4DoH7). 
- [[Flancian]] using [An Agora](https://anagora.org/), an app he developed himself. 
- [[Mathew Lowry]], using his platform, [MyHub](MyHub.ai), but not live, since he is in Belgium. He will also experiment with multiple apps.
