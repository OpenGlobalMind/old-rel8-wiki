# Scribing Tools for Thinking

This page is base camp for people interested in "scribing" the Tools for Thinking sessions that Betaworks is hosting over the next few months. 

### Scribing?

There are many ways we might describe the activity of filtering, annotating, enhancing, connecting and mapping conversations, including:

- Scribing
- Annotating, Notetaking
- Context Weaving
- Curating
- Mapping

Let's pick one we love and rename the role (and this page). 

### This project

Betaworks is hosting a chain of events around the topic of Tools for Thinking, starting with [this Render session](https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking) on August 16. In order to show how Tools for Thinking can actually enrich the conversations and interactions, Jerry is marshaling Scribes to participate as a bit of a [Greek Chorus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_chorus) during the events. 

Unlike Greek Choruses, which apparently were intentionally homogeneous, our Scribes will be quite individualistic: each will work in the tool of their choice, curating as they prefer to. Those apps will include Roam, Miro, Kumu, TheBrain, Obsidian and An Agora. 

Where possible, we will create linkages between the different sets of notes and maps, so that they form a loosely navigable whole. 

### Our Scribes

The following folks will be scribing the Tools for Thinking series:

- [[Jerry Michalski]], using TheBrain, [like this](https://bra.in/5qeDMg). His notes for these events will start [here](https://bra.in/4jrLy5).
