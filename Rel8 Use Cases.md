# Rel8 Use Cases

What new things will Rel8 enable? Here are some examples, to light our imaginations: 

- Rethinking books and presentations as playlists. [[Jerry Michalski|Jerry]] posted [a video describing this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWkwOefBPZY). 
- Constructing points of view by chaining together "nuggets" into "narratives," then aggregating those into points of view. Video explanation [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmId2x6JSQE&feature=related).
- Shared [[Notetaking Systems and Tools|notetaking]] using different applications. Imagine a note created in TheBrain, then editable in Roam, etc. 

These use cases illustrate [[Rel8's Mosaic]].
