# Rel8 Mid-Term Goals
What will it take to create a large-scale shared memory that:

- Is crowdsourced like Wikipedia
- Allows participants to use multiple memory- and context-making tools (Roam, Kumu, TheBrain, etc.)
- Allows participants to express their own points of view (unlike Wikipedia)

Bonus points if it: 

- Separates data from tools used to generate and visualize it
- Encourages "crystallizing" points of view to reduce divergence and chaos 

Think of this memory as a layer "above" Wikipedia, Google and the normal Web. 


Here are Rel8's [[Rel8 Short-Term Goals|Short-Term]] and [[Rel8 Long-Term Goals|Long-Term]] Goals. 

To relate our insights, data, beliefs, we're doing to use X tools and Y processes. 

Thoughts to incorporate:

- Everything is linked
- Provisional structure 
- Temporary hierarchies (perspective)
- Persistent place 
- Instrumental
