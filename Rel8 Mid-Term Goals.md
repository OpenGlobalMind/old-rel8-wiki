- Separates data from tools used to generate and visualize it
- Allows participants to use multiple memory- and context-making tools
- Allows participants to express their own points of view
- Encourages "crystallizing" points of view to reduce divergence and chaos

- Temporary hierarchies (perspective)
- Persistent place 
- Instrumental
