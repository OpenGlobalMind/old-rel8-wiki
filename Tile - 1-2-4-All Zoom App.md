# Tile - 1-2-4-All Zoom App
[1, 2, 4, All](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) is a Pattern in the brilliant [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/) Pattern Language, intended for group process facilitators. 

This pattern is also known as "Think, Pair Share," which describes its process: if your group faces a thorny question, give them each time to think on their own (1), then pair them up (2), then put them in fours (4), then bring everyone back to plenary (all). 

When the Pandemic struck, most conversations got shoved into Zoom rectangles. [Zoom Apps](https://explore.zoom.us/docs/en-us/zoom-apps.html) are a relatively new addition to the Zoom platform.
