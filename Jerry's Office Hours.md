# Jerry's Office Hours
## Groundrules
These are [[Jerry Michalski]]'s office hours, not [[standing calls]], so it's Jerry working with his garage door open. 

You are very welcome to join him; your presence ~~will~~ should help him get things done. The table below shows what he'll be focusing on for each session. 

He holds these calls in his Zoom, [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4154650256?pwd=Zm5DWGRJcmFmZGtBMmI1Wkx2WUQyZz09). Most he will record and post online, with links in the table below. 

You can find other flotilla members' office hours [here](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/ogm_culture/office_hours).
