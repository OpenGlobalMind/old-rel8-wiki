# Jerry's Office Hours
## Groundrules
These are office hours, not standing calls, so it's Jerry working with the garage door open. You are welcome to join; your presence will help me get things done. The table below shows what I'll be focusing on for each session. 

I host these calls in my Zoom, here.
