# Jerry's Office Hours
## Groundrules
These are office hours, not standing calls, so it's Jerry working with his garage door open. You are welcome to join; your presence ~~will~~ should help him get things done. The table below shows what he'll be focusing on for each session. 

These calls are in his Zoom, [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/4154650256?pwd=Zm5DWGRJcmFmZGtBMmI1Wkx2WUQyZz09).
