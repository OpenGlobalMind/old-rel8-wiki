# Rel8 Wiki
Rel8 is born from two questions:

- Why is it so difficult for us to share our notes?
- Why don't we [know what we know](https://www.amazon.com/Only-Knew-What-Know-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B005PSJ2J2/jerrymichalskisr) collectively? 

At the very personal scale, plenty of individuals are perfecting their note-taking, but usually those notes are just for themselves. The rest of us are often duplicating those efforts and not benefiting from the possibilities of a hive mind. 

At the larger organizational scale, plenty of companies and nonprofits are tktk

Rel8 is a shepherding and stewarding project, not a coding project to build yet another platform. 

Instead, Rel8 is figuring out what conditions, organizations and dynamics need to exist so we can create a shared memory. This mission requires:

- Convening solution-finding conversations
- Creating prototype code and use cases to illustrate what's possible and why
