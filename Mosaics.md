# Mosaics
Mosaics are low-resolution visions of a project's goals, ambitions and methods. 

They help individuals decide where to put their energy, and other project figure out where the overlaps and resonances lie. 

Mosaics are just one metaphor; you may think of them as tapestries, quilts or impressionist paintings. They are woven, connected, patchy, imprecise, soulful, urgent. 

One nice reason to use the Mosaic metaphor is that they are composed of tiles, which we are using to describe programming projects that contribute to the greater mosaic. You can learn more about them in the [[Tiles]] section.
