Some relevant bits here: 

Jerry curates the world's largest man-made mind map, which began when he was briefed by the makers of TheBrain about their new app. He started using it 24+ years ago, and never looked back. More about it at [[Jerry's Brain]]. 

The data in Jerry's Brain is a great starter for "inoculating" [[The Big Fungus]], a metaphoric way of thinking about our emergent shared memory. 

Jerry would like to write a next-generation book titled [[What If We Trusted You]]. 

He's also created placeholder websites for initiatives that ought to exist, such as:

- The Betterverse
