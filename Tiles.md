# Rel8 Tiles
Tiles are smallish, modular code projects that we scope, fund, write, then share as open source. 

We call them Tiles because they are part of larger Mosaics (or Tapestry, if you prefer), which paint visions of where projects are headed. 

A good Tile serves several projects, solving a problem they share in a general way. 

Here's a table of our Tiles, finished and proposed:
