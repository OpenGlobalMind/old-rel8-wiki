# Rel8 Tiles
Tiles are smallish, modular code elements that we scope, fund, write, then share as open source. 

A Project may have many Tiles. A narrative that connects several Projects is a Mosaic, essentially a vision of where the collection of Projects is headed. 

We call them Tiles because they are part of larger [[Mosaics]] (or Tapestry, if you prefer), which paint visions of where projects are headed. 

A good Tile serves several Projects, solving a problem they share in a general way. 

Here is our [[Tiles Wishlist]].

Here's a table of our Tiles, finished and proposed:
