# Rel8 (and OGM) Vision Video

Brainstorming a script: 

- Because extreme voices are so loud and visible, we aren't hearing from moderates. 
- Breaking the ideas apart might help us share what we have in common and make progress.

Narrative Arc:
- So we don't all keep duplicating effort (reinventing the wheel)
- Collaborations
- Preserve personal preferences and points of view
- Encourage "crystalization" of points of view
- Bridge and changing disciplines
- Governance: how? 
- Financing
- Survey of other vision videos
- Create this video using our own tools and concepts (woven, linky, shared)
