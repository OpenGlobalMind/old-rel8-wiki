# Help Create This Wiki
This page holds geeky info for how to edit Massive Wiki, the platform that Rel8 Wiki is built atop. 

We value crispness, modularity and composability. Please follow the [[Writing Style for This Project]]

Massive Wiki is built atop GitHub (we may move to a different Git host, but Git is central), which means Rel8 Wiki pages obey GitHub's [Fork and Pull](https://reflectoring.io/github-fork-and-pull/) dynamics, which are an elegant (if geeky) way to collaborate. 

So: To help edit and improve the Rel8 Wiki, create an account on GitHub, then fork [the Rel8 repository](https://github.com/OpenGlobalMind/rel8-wiki) into your own account. Then send pull requests with edits and additions. 

More detailed info on Massive Wiki is over in [its wiki](https://massive.wiki/). There's also [a Mattermost channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki) dedicated to it.
