# Turbocharging Pattern Languages

This is a [[Rel8 Projects|Rel8 Project]].

Pattern Languages are community projects that make distilled wisdom more accessible. We are big fans of several existing Pattern Languages, including: 
- [Peeragogy](https://peeragogy.org/)
- [Liberating Structures](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/)
- [The Wise Democracy Pattern Language](https://www.wd-pl.com/) 
- [An Open Source Pattern Language (re)generative of Commons](https://debategraph.org/Details.aspx?nid=329727)

Pattern Languages tktk 

To Turbocharge Pattern Languages, we might:

- Weave them together
- "Instrument" them, where appropriate (see [[Tile - 1-2-4-All Zoom App]])
- Lather, rinse, repeat for more wise nuggets that are instrumentable
